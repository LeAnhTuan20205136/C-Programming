/* Write an algorithm for choosing clothes
to wear for different activities involving
different weather conditions (e.g., going
to the beach when it is hot, skiing in the
snow, etc.). The algorithm should make
it clear how the choice of clothes
depends on the weather and the activity,
and should be able to cope with a range of
weather conditions. */
